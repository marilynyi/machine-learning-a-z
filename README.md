# Overview

This repository houses all guided projects I have written during the [Machine Learning A-Z course](https://www.udemy.com/course/machinelearning/) on Udemy.

>The course aims to fulfill the following learning objectives:
>
>- What youâ€™ll learn
>- Master Machine Learning on Python & R
>- Have a great intuition of many Machine Learning models
>- Make accurate predictions
>- Make powerful analysis
>- Make robust Machine Learning models
>- Create strong added value to your business
>- Use Machine Learning for personal purpose
>- Handle specific topics like Reinforcement Learning, NLP and Deep Learning
>- Handle advanced techniques like Dimensionality Reduction
>- Know which Machine Learning model to choose for each type of problem
>- Build an army of powerful Machine Learning models and know how to combine them to solve any problem
